"""A bank has many customers and each customer has a bank account
There are also privileged customers
who can earn bonus points for each of their transaction.
This scenario is depicted through the below class diagram.

Customer
- customer_id
- customer_name
- age
- account
__init__(customer_id, customer_name, age, account)
+ withdraw(amount)
+ take_card()
+ get_customer_id()
+ get_customer_name()
+ get_age()
+ get_account()
Account
- account_type
- balance
- min_balance
__init__(account_type,balance,min_balance)
+ get_account_type()
+ get_balance()
+ get_min_balance()
+ set_balance(balance)
PrivilegedCustomer
- bonus_points
__init__ (customer_id, customer_name, age, account,
bonus_points)
+ withdraw(amount)
+ get_bonus_points()
- increase_bonus()
OverdrawException
LimitReachedException

RULES TO FOLLOW
================
Customer:
withdraw(amount): This method should reduce the account balance based on the amount withdrawn.
Raise the following exceptions based on the given conditions.
OverdrawException - If the amount to be withdrawn is greater than account balance.
LimitReachedException - If the balance amount is less than minimum account balance.
take_card(): Displays the message "Take card out from the ATM".
PrivilegedCustomer:
increase_bonus(): If the account balance is greater than 1000, increase the bonus points by 10, else increase it by 2.
withdraw(amount): Invoke the parent class withdraw() method and increase the bonus points by calling increase_bonus() method, if no exceptions occured.
If exceptions occur, display relevant messages. Ensure that the card is taken out from the ATM under any situation.

Write a Python program to create a new PrivilegedCustomer with below details:
Customer Id: 100
Customer Name: Gopal
Age: 43
Bonus Points: 100
Account Type: Savings
Account Balance: 1000
Account minimum: 500

The customer should be able to withdraw money and also display the bonus points of the customer after the withdraw."""

"""A company is in the process of providing annual hike to its employees based on incentives and performance of the employee.
A partial python program has been written for the above requirement, complete the code by using the information and part of class diagram given below:


RULES TO FOLLOW
=================
Class Description:
The program has three classes â€“ Company, Employee and PermanentEmployee. Company and Employee classes are already coded for you. Refer starter code.

Employee class:
Every employee is given a performance rating (1-3) at the end of every year
Last five year's performance rating of an employee is stored in the attribute, performance_list
Refer table for example and interpretation of data in performance_list, assuming current year is 2015
Permanent Employee class:
identify_performance_hike():
Permanent employees are eligible for performance hike based on their last three years performance as given in table
Identify the hike % and return it. If hike is not applicable, return None
identify_job_level_hike():
Permanent employees are eligible for hike based on job level
Identify job level based hike using the information provided in the Company class and return it. If hike cannot be identified, return None
identify_incentive():
Permanent employees are eligible for company level, employee level and permanent employee level incentives
Calculate total incentive (in Rs) and return it
calculate_salary(): Calculate total salary
Implement it in the same way as it is implemented in Employee class
Note: Perform case sensitive string comparison 
For testing:
Create objects of Company class and PermanentEmployee class
Invoke calculate_salary() on PermanentEmployee object
Display the details of the employee
